# Trakker app

Trakker is a simple time tracking menubar app that works with Toggl.
Made with Electron, React, Webpack, Babel, Figma and [toggl api](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs).

## Development

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install` and then in two separate terminal windows:
* `npm start` and `npm run electron`

## TODO

This is a first iteration (aka proof of concept) of the app and although it is very useful to quickly track time there is a lot of room for improvements. E.g. change/add task project, check if timer is stopped from webapp, etc.
I'm currently working on darwin `.app` package to be ready for distribution.
